Gang of four
Little's law - states that response time is inversly prop to throughput
IRCTC could not scale a few years back 

Physical scaling limits 
    1) CPU
    2) Memory
    3) Networks
    4) Disks

1TB | 500 seconds(SSD 2GBps) | 2000 seconds (non SSD 500MBps)

Data Sharding using ModernDay DB's - Cassandra, Kafka , AZ Cosmos

With Horizontal Scaling, Failure chances increases as sample space increases. 
1 Disk fails once in 1000 days.
1000 such disks -> Prob of one failing at a day is 1/1

Write Ahead Log  (Process Crash)
------------------
If Server fails, preserve data without flushingx the state, which maybe spread across distributed disks.
Maintain a single log for each server process which is squentialy appended.
Log before appending
go back to log to retrieve state upon server comes back up


Generational Clock  (Process Pause)
-------------------
A clock that is incremented every time a server is restarted. 
When a server takes a Pause and then comes back up, it can use the clock value to determine if it should apply the state from the log.
Generational Number is stored on a shared storage


Qourum Overlap
---------------
If a server takes any action, it needs to ensure that it has a quorum of servers that are up.
Cluster size = 2f + 1 nodes
f = number of servers that will fail


Paxos
------
When data is inconsitent across the cluster, a leader election is needed.
